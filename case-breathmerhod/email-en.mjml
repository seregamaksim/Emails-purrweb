        <mj-text css-class="text" mj-class="text">Every year more and more companies go online, and the pandemic is only increasing the number of applicants. This happened to our customers, Carolina and Dominik from Singapore.</mj-text>
        <mj-text css-class="text" mj-class="text">Their business was related to yoga and breathing practices, and when coronavirus hit, they decided to switch to digital format. Plus, since most people started to work remotely, the profitability of mobile health and fitness apps increased by about 280%.</mj-text>
        <mj-text css-class="text" mj-class="text">Initially, Dominic and Carolina wanted us to create UI/UX design and planned to hire another company for the development. But during phone meetings we agreed on creating the MVP of Breathmethod app. We faced the challenge: how to bring the client‚Äôs idea to life, make the app stand out from famous competitors and help the client prepare for the second wave of Covid-19.</mj-text>

        <mj-text css-class="text" mj-class="text">The clients knew what they wanted but had no idea how to accomplish it. They shared their preferences and asked to avoid illustrations, since it wouldn‚Äôt work for the target audience.</mj-text>
        <mj-text css-class="text" mj-class="text">We combined gray concrete, lush green, light wood and made images with plants, rocks and water the core part of the design. Lively patterns and natural colors help users to relax and set their minds on breathing.</mj-text>

        <mj-text css-class="text" mj-class="text">We compared major competitors and found out that most apps lacked breathing practices ‚Äî so we decided to focus on them. Together with the client we included 3 types of content at the MVP stage:</mj-text>

        <mj-text css-class="text" mj-class="text">We used our good ol‚Äô tech stack ‚Äî React Native + Nest.js. React Native is great for mobile apps, especially for MVPs, since it saves money on development ‚Äî it‚Äôs possible to develop an app both for iOS and Android.</mj-text>
        <mj-text css-class="text" mj-class="text">The clients wanted users to be able to ‚Äòpractice breathing on the go‚Äô. We were worried that it would be difficult to play audio when the screen is locked but it turned out to be easy. We used parameters in React-Native-video library and once again were happy with the chosen stack.</mj-text>

        <mj-text css-class="text" mj-class="text">Carolina asked us to build a landing page and pull posts from the Breathmethod Instagram account on it. We used Gatsby.js for the landing page, and its plugin ‚Äògatsby-source-instagram‚Äô to upload the posts.</mj-text>
        <mj-text css-class="text" mj-class="text">Got access to the Instagram posts, created an algorithm that sorts the last 10 posts, and implemented a slider. Then connected our repository with the landing page to Netlify, a service for hosting web apps.</mj-text>
        <mj-text css-class="text" mj-class="text">Then we faced a problem ‚Äî Instagram reduced the functionality of the Gatsby plugin to fight with fakes, so we couldn‚Äôt monitor the posts automatically. We used Zapier to automate Netlify‚Äôs deployments and now we can update the Instagram feed on the landing page on a daily basis.</mj-text>

        <mj-text css-class="text" mj-class="text">The client insisted on integrating with Apple ID. It was the first time we had such a request from a client, so we thought that it would be difficult and take much time. In fact, we managed to finish everything in one day ‚Äî we made it so that the app scans the device and finds out whether it has a Face ID/ Touch ID. If it doesn‚Äôt, the app will ask the user to think up a code.</mj-text>

        <mj-text css-class="text" mj-class="text">The store claimed that the Breathmethod app has no subscriptions and didn‚Äôt submit it for several weeks. We were persistent and sent them a lot of screenshots with proof. Finally, we made it ‚Äî the app is now available on the App Store and Google Play.</mj-text>
        <mj-text css-class="text" mj-class="text">Now we negotiate with the client to start the development of an Apple TV app, since the number of users is growing and the Breathmethod content is suitable for this video service.</mj-text>
